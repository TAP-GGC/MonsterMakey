# MonsterMakey

## About
Monster Makey is a project about using sound audio for storytelling. The project is used to engage students and show how to edit audio in a software called, Audacity and how to produce sound through a technology called, Makey Makey. Our target audience is students who would be interested in STEM and possibly be interested in the TAP program. TAP is a Technology Ambassadors Program for students who are interested in Information Technology; the program lets students learn more about different technologies during their fun project [TAP Link](https://www.ggc.edu/academics/school-of-science-and-technology/research-internships-service-learning/technology-ambassador-program). Here is a link to our project demo [Monster Makey Demo](Media/ProjectDemo.md).

## Technology
The technology our project used was Audacity and Makey Makey. Audacity is a free open-source software for editing different audio. Makey Makey is a small circuit board that can hook up to any computer and use wire to hook to any item that can be used to conduct electricity.
