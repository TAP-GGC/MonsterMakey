# MonsterMakey

## About
Monster Makey is a project about using sound audio for storytelling. The project is used to engage students and show how to edit audio in a software called, Audacity and how to produce sound through a technology called, Makey Makey. Our target audience is students who would be interested in STEM and possibly be interested in the TAP program. TAP is a Technology Ambassadors Program for students who are interested in Information Technology; the program lets students learn more about different technologies during their fun project.
